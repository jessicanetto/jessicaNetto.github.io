    <h3>Based in New York City</h3>
    <p>I am a creator and innovator committed to always leaving things in better shape than when I found them. </br>
        While supporting research studies that answered how the brain works, I wished that I could delve deeper into the
        technology that</br> powered the experiments and the algorithms that interpreted the brain signal data. </br>
        This is what inspired me to become a software engineer.
        </br> I aspire to have a career in which I can utilize my combined knowledge and skillset to contribute to a
        mission I truly believe in.
    </p>

    <p> Skilled in: Matlab, SPSS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, React, Redux, PostgreSQL and Paired Programming. </p>

        <p> I am deeply fascinated with the field of neurotechonology and its applications in the realm of virtual and
            augmented realities. </p>

                <li>[Snowman]
                    Created using JavaScript, this game implements objects and arrays throughout the control flow. The
                    objective of the game is to correctly guess letters until you have no remaining slots to fill. This
                    task is made challenging by the limit imposed by a maximum guess counter function

                </br>
                <li> [New Year’s Eve Text-Based-Adventure]
                    Inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic’s attendance restriction for the New York City ball-drop in Times
                    Square, this game is a simulation of attending the event as is traditionally done. Loops and
                    conditionals are in place to navigate from start to finish with an enthralling dialogue to follow in
                    the console.
                </li>
                </br>
                <li> [Wonder Will They Wander]
                    Created with PsychToolBox software for MATLAB to develop an eye-tracking experiment using a Tobii
                    Pro Spectrum to measure levels of apathy when exposed to a stimulus meant to illicit compassion.
                </li>
